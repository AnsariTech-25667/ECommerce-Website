# 🛒 E-Commerce Website

Welcome to my little corner of the internet where shopping meets code.
This is a **full-stack MERN e-commerce app** built the way modern companies actually do it: scalable, modular, and a little over-engineered (on purpose).

Think of it as an online store, but also as a playground to show off some serious engineering chops.

## 🚀 Tech Stack (a.k.a my toolkit)

* **Frontend:** React + Vite (because life’s too short for slow builds)
* **UI:** Tailwind CSS + Shadcn (clean, modern, and responsive without crying over CSS files)
* **State Management:** Redux Toolkit (shopping carts + global state = best friends)
* **Data Layer:** Tanstack Query + EncoreJS (because caching API calls like a pro is non-negotiable)
* **Backend:** Node.js + Express (battle-tested, simple, effective)
* **Database:** MongoDB with Mongoose (flexible enough for product catalogs that keep changing)
* **Extras:** Puppeteer (auto-generating invoices/PDFs like Amazon), TypeScript (because bugs are expensive)

Every tool here was picked deliberately: performance, scalability, and developer sanity.

## ⚙️ Getting Started

Clone it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AnsariTech-25667/ECommerce-Website.git
cd ECommerce-Website
```

**Backend** 🛠️

```bash
cd server
npm install
npm run dev
```

Runs on `http://localhost:5000`

**Frontend** 🎨

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```

Runs on `http://localhost:5173`

👉 Make sure MongoDB is running (local or Atlas).

## 💡 What This Project Does

* User login & session handling
* Product listings with categories & filters
* Add-to-cart & cart persistence
* Checkout flow (with payment simulation)
* Auto-generated invoices via Puppeteer (because nothing says “real app” like a PDF receipt)

Basically, it’s the backbone of any e-commerce business without the headaches of deploying to production just yet.

## 🎯 Why Build It Like This?

Because real-world apps aren’t tutorials.
They have layers: a clean separation between frontend, backend, and database, yet everything connects smoothly.

* React + Vite = developer happiness + blazing speed
* Tailwind + Shadcn = pixel-perfect UI without bloated CSS
* Express + MongoDB = flexible backend that scales
* Puppeteer = adds that “Amazon-like” touch of professionalism

It’s not just code, it’s **architecture**.

## 📌 Closing Thoughts

This repo is more than a project, it’s proof of my ability to take an idea, break it down into pieces, and stitch it back into a working, scalable full-stack application.

If you’re scrolling through this as a recruiter or developer: welcome to my build, and yes, the cart actually works 😉
