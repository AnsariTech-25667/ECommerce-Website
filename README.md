# üõí E-Commerce Website

A full-stack MERN application built to demonstrate modern web development practices, scalable architecture, and seamless user experience for online shopping platforms. This project was created as part of my internship assignment and designed to reflect real-world e-commerce functionality.

## üöÄ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React.js, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, Redux Toolkit, Vite  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js  
- **Database:** MongoDB (Mongoose ORM)  
- **Utilities & Tools:** Tanstack Query, EncoreJS, Puppeteer (for PDF generation), TypeScript  

Each technology was chosen for performance, scalability, and developer productivity. React with Vite ensures blazing-fast development and optimized builds, while Tailwind + Shadcn provides elegant UI components. Redux Toolkit and Tanstack Query handle state and data synchronization efficiently. On the backend, Express with MongoDB enables robust APIs, and Puppeteer automates PDF creation for receipts or reports.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Running the Project

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AnsariTech-25667/ECommerce-Website.git
cd ECommerce-Website
````

### 1. Backend (Server)

```bash
cd server
npm install
npm run dev
```

Server runs at `http://localhost:5000`.

### 2. Frontend (Client)

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```

Client runs at `http://localhost:5173`.

Ensure MongoDB is running locally or connect via MongoDB Atlas.

## üí° Project Overview

This project simulates the **core workflow of a modern e-commerce system**:

* User authentication and session handling
* Product listing with categories and filters
* Shopping cart with Redux state management
* Secure checkout process
* PDF generation of invoices using Puppeteer

The aim was to design a modular, production-ready codebase where each layer (frontend, backend, database) is cleanly separated but seamlessly integrated.

## üõ†Ô∏è Why This Stack?

* **React + Vite:** Provides lightning-fast HMR, modular routing, and better DX compared to CRA.
* **Redux Toolkit:** Simplifies state management with less boilerplate and better devtools support.
* **Tailwind + Shadcn:** Delivers modern, responsive UI with consistent design patterns.
* **Express.js:** Lightweight yet powerful backend framework, perfect for REST APIs.
* **MongoDB:** Flexible schema design ideal for product-based applications.
* **Puppeteer:** Automates browser rendering for generating downloadable invoices and reports, enhancing realism.
* **EncoreJS & Tanstack Query:** Improves API data fetching, caching, and synchronization in the frontend.

## üéØ Why It Was Built This Way

The focus was to **mirror enterprise-grade workflows**: modular architecture, reusable components, and real-world integrations like PDF receipts. Each design choice emphasizes scalability, performance, and user experience, making it easier to extend into a production system. This project serves as both a learning experience and a portfolio showcase of my ability to build complex full-stack applications.

## üìå Conclusion

This e-commerce platform demonstrates modern web development principles, combining cutting-edge libraries with practical features. Its layered approach and clear structure make it easy to maintain, extend, and deploy, aligning with industry-level standards for full-stack engineering.

‚úÖ Word count: **~452 words** (just right).  

Do you also want me to add a **screenshots/demo section** at the end so recruiters visually see the app? That would make the README even more impressive.
